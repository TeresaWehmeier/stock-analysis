# Refactoring VBA Code in Excel

# Overview of the Project
A friend asked for help with a stock analysis for his parents. He provided a data set for two years and twelve green stocks. Although he has some Microsoft Excel skills, he wants some help using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to compile annual volume and return for the tweleve stocks. After reviewing the analysis with the new script, he decided he wants to analyze larger amounts of data from the stock market. Although the script created works for a small data set, it is not designed for large volumes of data and calculations. Instead of trying to write a new script, refactoring the code to accommodate larger data sets, and improve system usage at the same time was determined to be a better option.
